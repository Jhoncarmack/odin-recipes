    <h3>Description</h3>
    Mexican birria tacos, Jalisco-style, made with braised beef that's
    slow-cooked in a fragrant 3-chile sauce with a delicious spice mix.
    <p>
      Crispy tacos, and tender, mouth-watering beef team up with melted Mexican
      cheese in this impressive meal. This recipe takes a little time but it's
      so worth it!
