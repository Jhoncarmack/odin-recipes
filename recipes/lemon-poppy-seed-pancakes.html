    <h5>ingredients</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>1 rounded tablespoon white sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon lemon zest, or more to taste</li>
      <li>5 teaspoons poppy seeds</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons butter, plus more for the pan</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
      <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>lemon wedges (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h6>Steps</h6>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine sugar and lemon zest, and stir to combine. Let stand about 15
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda together in a separate
        bowl. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add poppy seeds, egg, and melted butter to the bowl of sugar, and whisk
        thoroughly. Add lemon juice, milk, and flour mixture. Whisk gently just
        until flour disappears. Let batter rest for 10 to 15 minutes before
        using.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat, and generously grease with
        melted butter or vegetable oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer about 1/3 cup of batter into the pan for each pancake, and cook
        until a few bubbles start to pop through the surface, 3 to 4 minutes.
        Flip and cook the second side 3 to 4 minutes. Serve immediately.
      </li>
