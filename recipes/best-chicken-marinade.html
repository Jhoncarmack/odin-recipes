    <h5>ingredients</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>⅔ cup olive oil</li>
      <li>⅔ cup reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
      <li>¼ cup lemon juice</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons liquid smoke flavoring</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons spicy brown mustard</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
      <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
    </ul>
    <h6>Steps</h6>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Mix olive oil, soy sauce, lemon juice, liquid smoke, mustard, pepper,
        and garlic powder together in a large glass or ceramic bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place chicken in the bowl and turn to coat with marinade. Cover and
        marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 4 hours. For best results, do not
        marinate longer than 4 hours.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
      <li>
        Remove chicken from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the
        remaining marinade.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center
        and the juices run clear, 6 to 8 minutes per side. An instant-read
        thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F
        (74 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
